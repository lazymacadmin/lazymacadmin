I used to be a Mac Admin and worked on things to make life easier for enterprise Mac administration.
I'm no longer able to continue working on these things, but they may work for you. There will be no issues, no upport, no future releases unless someone steps up to take this over.

I wish you all well and hope something I've done can help you.
